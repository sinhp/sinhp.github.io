`Abstract:` Every topos has an internal higher-order intuitionistic logic. The so-called Kripke–Joyal semantics of a topos gives an interpretation to formulas written in this language used to express ordinary mathematics in that topos. The Kripke–Joyal semantics is in fact a higher order generalization of the well-known Kripke semantic for intuitionistic propositional logic. In this talk I shall report on joint work with Steve Awodey and Nicola Gambino on extending the Kripke–Joyal semantics to dependent type theories, including homotopy type theory.

I also gave a talk on the same work in [YaMCATS](https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/mathematics/extranet/staff-material/staff-profiles/simona-paoli/abstract-sina-hazratpur). Here I also explained the standard Beth-Kripke semantics --and how it extend to Kripke-Joyal semantics-- since the large audience comprised of very diverse background.
