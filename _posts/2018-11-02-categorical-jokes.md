First, make sure you check an amusing list of [mathematical short stories](https://www.matem.unam.mx/~omar/notes/index.html) and [Things I was surprised to learn are false](https://www.matem.unam.mx/~omar/notes/surprises.html) on Camarena' web page. 



## Jokes

* A monad over a category $\cat{C}$ is a monoid in the category of endofunctors $[\cat{C}, \cat{C}]$. 

* A monoid is a category with one object and a group is a groupoid with one object. 

* Shall we call categories _monoidoids_? 

* A category is an interanl monad in the bicategory $Span(\Set)$. 

* A ring is an $Ab$-enriched category with one object. 

* A (right) module $M$ over a ring $R$ is an $Ab$-enriched functor $M\maps *_R \to Ab$.



## Factoids

* The Grothendieck construction of representable presheaves and copresheaves yield slice and coslice categories. 

* For a group (groupoid) $G$, the Grothendieck construction of a $G$-set $X$, considered as a functor $X\maps BG \to \Set$, yields the action group (groupoid).

* The forgetful functor $\Set_* \to \Set$ has a special status amongs the forgetful functors in the 2-category of categories: it is the universal discrete opfibration. (If you classify laxly then $1 \to \Set$ is the classifier.)

* The longest series of adjoint functors has six components; one of them is the Yoneda embedding. (Guess which one?)   

* A category is equivalent to a small category if and only if both it and its presheaf category are locally small. ([On the Size of Categories, Peter Freyd and Ross Street, TAC 1995](http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/1995/n9/1-09abs.html))

* A small category with all (small) limits is equivalent to a complete (and hence cocomplete) lattice. 

  * (improvement by J. ADAMEK. H. HERRLICH, AND J. REITERMAN) Any cocomplete weakly co-wellpowered category with a weakly colimit-dense small subcategory is complete.



### Mathematical terms beginning with "s": 

While attending the school and conference "toposes in Como", we had several hikes, usually late at night, with Ingo, Mathias, Stuart, Alexander, and few others. In one of these nights, while coming back from our hike, at 3:00 AM, we started a little joke of recalling technical mathematical terms based on their first letter. We noticed the terms beginning with "s" occuring disproportionally more than the others. Ingo did a great effort of listing them in an email a month later. In his email to the group he wrote 

<blockquote cite="http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0000hB">
          <p> below is a list of technical terms in category theory and adjacent
subjects which begin with the letter "s". Extracted from the contents of
the nLab, roughly in descending order of number of occurrences on the
nLab, cut at some arbitrary point. Some entries are debatable. I omitted
the deluge of terms of the form "super" + X, where X is a random word. :-)
