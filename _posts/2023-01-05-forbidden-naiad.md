> But quite apart from the magnétiseur and fresco-painter Wagner, there is another Wagner who lays aside small gems: our greatest melancholiac in music, full of glances, tendernesses, and comforting words in which nobody has anticipated him, the master in tones of a heavy-hearted and drowsy happiness.

Tonight I was at the Concert-Gebouw for Wagner's die Walküre conducted by [Jaap van Zwede](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=jaap+van+zwede+concert+gebouw&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8), Singers Stuart Skelton (Siegmund), Anja Kampe (Sieglinde), and bariton Kwangchul Youn (Hunding). It was a brilliant performance, way above my expectation. 

<!-- The [Trouw's review](https://www.trouw.nl/cultuur-media/jaap-van-zweden-begint-met-een-briesje-maar-laat-het-dan-stormen-in-het-concertgebouw~bd9ea7f1/?referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F) is not fair in my opinion. It complains about the lack of staging, acting, forceful drama. It does not give enough credit to great singing of Anja Kampe (Sieglinde) and unblievable force in Skelton's “Wälse! Wälse!” palpable at the bottom of my feet.    -->
