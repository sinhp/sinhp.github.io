   * <details> 
      <summary>Core features of the game:</summary>
      <p>
       <ul> 
        <li>  Competitive play.Your game must allow players to compete.
        </li>
        <li> Networking.Your  game  must  allow  multiple  players  to  play  across  a  network. The  specific  net-working arrangement depends on the type of game but, for example, you might create a client-server typearrangement in which multiple clients connect to a controlling server, or a server performing some otherservice.
        </li>    
        <li>  Artificial Intelligence.Your game must have the option of computer-controlled players. These mightbe individual or team players, depending on the type of game.
        </li> 
        <li> User Interface.Your game must have a user interface, i.e.  a convenient way for players to interactwith the game.  This will almost certainly require a menu as a minimum but will more than likely alsorequire other interface entities such as dialog windows that have a range of controls, clickable icons, etc.The user interface will also include crucial feedback information for the player.
