<h2 id="notes"><font color="#336666">Expository Papers And Notes</font></h2>

Writing notes helps me to grasp a mathematical concept or construction and they become less elusive in my mind. Here are the notes 
from some of my talks for which I had time to type them up. Any reports of mistakes and errors from the reader are always welcome. Also, suggestions and recommendations on how to improve a presentation of a concept or how to communicate the essential ideas of a construction are greatly appreciated.
