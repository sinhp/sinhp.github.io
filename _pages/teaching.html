<p> I have been demonstrator for several modules during my time in Birmingham, and the experience has been quite positive for me. Transitioning from a pure mathematics backgound to a computer science department was not as straight forward but it ultimately worked out well. Not only do these two worlds have different cultures but also they require a different set of skills and more importantly a different mindset particulary for teaching students.

<p> Also, during my masters programme at Western I had a lot of TAing to do. Other than usual routine Calculus and Linear Algebra teaching and helping students in help centre, <a href="http://www-home.math.uwo.ca/~mpinson/" target="_blank"><font color="#336666">Martin Pinsonnault</font></a> and I were running training sessions for Western maths team for <a href="https://www.maa.org/math-competitions/putnam-competition" target="_blank"><font color="#336666">Putnam competition</font></a> in 2013 and 2014 which was quite fun. </p>
