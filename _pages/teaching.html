<p> I am currently teaching introduction to proofs at Johns Hopkins University. The course introduces students to the natural deduction style of encoding proofs in intuitionistic propositional logic and first order logic. Proof strategies such as proof by cases, negation introduction, proof by contradiction, induction, etc are justified by natural deduction. Later, students are familiarized with proofs on abstract mathematical structures such as finite and infinite sets, ordered sets, metric spaces, and topological spaces. They are introduced to methods of writing proofs which are rigorous, readable, and elegant. Mathematical communication, both written and spoken, is emphasized throughout the course. In this course, students also explore proof-relevant mathemetics by interacting with the Lean proof assistant.

<p> I have been demonstrator for several modules during my time in Birmingham, and the experience has been quite positive for me. Transitioning from a pure mathematics backgound to a computer science department was not as straight forward but it ultimately worked out well. Not only do these two worlds have different cultures but also they require a different set of skills and more importantly a different mindset particulary for teaching students.

<p> Also, during my masters programme at Western I had a lot of TAing to do. Other than usual routine Calculus and Linear Algebra teaching and helping students in help centre, <a href="http://www-home.math.uwo.ca/~mpinson/" target="_blank"><font color="#336666">Martin Pinsonnault</font></a> and I were running training sessions for Western maths team for <a href="https://www.maa.org/math-competitions/putnam-competition" target="_blank"><font color="#336666">Putnam competition</font></a> in 2013 and 2014 which was quite fun. </p>
