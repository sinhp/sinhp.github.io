## Some of my favourite maths and computer science blogs

* [nLab](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/HomePage):
 a wiki-lab for collaborative work on Mathematics, Physics and Philosophy heavily oriented toward discussions on category theory
and higher category theory. I started using nLab since 2014 and since then it has literally become a place where I spent a good deal of time learning about category theory and higher category theory. I also have seen how beautifully the collaborative effort of many people has resulted in such a great database. Remarkably there has been a great expansion of pages since first time I was there. If your work involves (higher) category theory then chances are you already know nLab and use it frequently. However, If you are new to category theory then use nLab, but take this advice with a grain of salt. I remember my first experience of learning category theory back in 2014 using nLab among other sources and it was first a bit confusing. There are sometimes incomplete sources and sometimes self-referential , or even worse non-terminating cross-linking of pages. _Not to mention that in order to learn category theory first you have to learn infinity categories._    

* [The n-Category Café](https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/):
 called n-Cafe for short, it is a A group blog where authors posts intriguing stuff on recent research work mostly on cateogry theory, higher category theory, categorical logic, diagrammatic reasoning, applied category theory. The posts are not too long and they tend to bring the core ideas to the front for general maths audience. 
 
* [HoTT Blog](https://homotopytypetheory.org/blog/):
  main blog for homotopy type theory (aka univalent foundation aka synthetic homotopy theory)
  
* [Mathematics without Apologies](https://mathematicswithoutapologies.wordpress.com/):
  An unapologetic guided tour of the mathematical life; a blog by Michael Harris. The posts and after-post discussions involve philosophy of mathematics, politics, science and ethics of academic activities, AI, etc. Some of the most heated intelligent debates I have ever seen online happened there.   

* [Existential Type](https://existentialtype.wordpress.com/): 
 blog of Bob Harper
  
* [Mathematics and Computation](http://math.andrej.com): 
 a blog by Andrej Bauer on connections between mathematics and the theory of computation 

* [Shtetl-Optimized](https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/):
  blog of Scott Aaronson
  
* [Physics Forum](https://www.physicsforums.com/insights/a-first-idea-of-quantum-field-theory/):
 ocassionally, I read the posts on mathematical physics on physics forum, particularly from Urs Schrieber and John Baez.  
 
* [Terence Tao's Blog](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/):
 a must-see blog if you are into combinatorics, probability theory, or analayis. 

* [Polymath Project](http://michaelnielsen.org/polymath1/index.php?title=Main_Page)

* [John Baez's Stuff](http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/)

* [Annoying Precision](https://qchu.wordpress.com/)

* [Noncommutative geometry](http://noncommutativegeometry.blogspot.co.uk/)

* [Low Dimensional Topology](https://ldtopology.wordpress.com/about/)

* [Dan Ghica's Lab Lunch](http://researchblogs.cs.bham.ac.uk/thelablunch/):
  a blog on game semantics, an interactive approach to denotational semantic, and feometry of synthesis among many other things

* [Graphical Linear Algebra](https://graphicallinearalgebra.net/about/): 
  learn linear algebra in a non-conventional diagrammatic way. 

* [Mathoverflow](https://mathoverflow.net/search?q=topos):
 one of the cool features of mathoverflow is that anybody can ask a research question about a paper/book and the author of that paper/book answers it!
e.g. 
  * [Peter May's answer](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/204167/why-should-have-peter-may-worked-with-cgwh-instead-of-cgh-in-the-geometry-of-it) 
  * [Lurie's answer to the question on the relation between toposes and infinity toposes](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/92454/relation-between-topos-and-infty-topos)


* [Tim Gowers's blog](https://gowers.wordpress.com/) 

* [Tricki](http://www.tricki.org/)
 A wiki of useful mathematical problem-solving techniques initiated by Tim Gowers.
 I came to know about this from a [lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3n-3ZVfZfEU) by Michael Harris introducing his book _The science of tricks_ where he mentioned this website.

* [XOR’S HAMMER](https://xorshammer.com/)

## This Wesbite


This website is hosted on **GitHub pages**. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. Pages are created by [Jekyll Now](http://www.jekyllnow.com/), a more user-friendly version of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and perfect for building minimal and static, yet beautiful, secure, and stable websites. A really quick and easy-to-follow guide is provided [here](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/). For a quick start, you can also find the source code for setting up your own website at [barryclark/jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now).  

I used the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io). This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).


Make sure you check this [guide](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) as well. Personally, I found it very useful and succinct.

### Why Jekyll at all? 

You can do so much with Jekyll. Some of the best web developers use it for building their own websites. Here is a good examples:
[CSS Wizardy](https://csswizardry.com/about/).

But if you are, like me, an academic and want to publish your website with the help of Jekyll as fast as possible and not necessarily concerned about how fancy your website should look like, you may be interested in reading
[Github for academics](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2013/06/04/github-for-academics/).

Also, a really cool maths blog on discrete geometry, graph theory, and other stuff built by Jekyll: [11011110](https://11011110.github.io/blog/)

### How to write maths with Jekyll? 

**MathJax** is an open source JavaScript display engine for mathematics that works in all browsers.

[Kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/) comes with optional support for LaTeX to PNG rendering via MathJax within math blocks. This [blogpost](http://gastonsanchez.com/visually-enforced/opinion/2014/02/16/Mathjax-with-jekyll/) has a good tutorial on how to use MathJax with Jekyll. Also, you will probably find the official [MathJax](http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/start.html) website useful.
