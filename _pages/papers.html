<!-- <p> My current research focuses on the burgeoning field of synthetic homotopy theory. I am interested in exploring the application of methods from synthetic homotopy theory in simplicial, cubical, equivariant homotopy theory, and K-theory. <br/>
I am also working on formalization of Reedy categories in Lean proof assistant.</p> -->

I am one of the organizers of category theory reading group (CARGO). The meetings takes place at the school of computer science on a weekly basis. The participants are mostly PhD students and research fellows in theoretical computer science.

<ul> 
  <li> From 2015-2017, CARGO meetings used to takes place at the school of computer science on every Tuesday at 2:00 p.m. in room 245. For the academic year of 2017-2018 we have our meetings on Thursdays at 11:00 a.m. in the same room.

Let me also mention the archive of our <a href="http://talks.bham.ac.uk/show/index/86" target="_blank"><font color="#002d72">Theory Seminars</font></a> talks on Fridays. I have given four talks in theory seminars and numerous talks in CARGO. Sometimes I find enough time and I write the notes of the talks which can be found in below.

 <li> Here is a list of topics considered to be discussed in Autumn 2017 in Category Reading Group seminars as well as informal archive for suggested topics since Summer 2015: <a href= "/files/CT/Potential-topics.pdf" target= "_blank"><font color="#002d72">Potential topics</font></a> and <a href= "https://cargo.bram.xyz/" target= "_blank"><font color="#002d72">Informal archive</font></a>.

<h3 id="notes"><font color="#002d72">Expository Papers And Notes</font></h3>

Writing notes helps me to grasp a mathematical concept or construction and they become less elusive in my mind. Here are the notes from some of my talks for which I had time to type them up. Any reports of mistakes and errors from the reader are always welcome. 
<!-- Also, suggestions and recommendations on how to improve a presentation of a concept or how to communicate the essential ideas of a construction are greatly appreciated.
