This PR defines monoidal and cartesian distributive categories, develop the API, and prove some main results. We show a closed monoidal category is distributive.

We also show that, for a category `C` with binary coproducts, the category of endofunctors `C тед C` is left distributive. This requires the following new file which develops a convenient API for the binary (co)products in the functor categories:
`CategoryTheory/Limits/FunctorCategory/Shapes/BinaryProducts`

In `Mathlib/CategoryTheory/Distributive/Cartesian` we show that the coproduct coprojections are monic in a cartesian distributive category.
