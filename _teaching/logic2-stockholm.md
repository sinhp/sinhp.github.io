[Logic II](https://utbildning.su.se/english/education/course-catalogue/mm/mm7022) is a second level logic course, giving an introduction to major topics of modern mathematical logic. It consists of three main parts:

- Computability and incompleteness: models of computability; (un)decidability and (un)computability; coding of logic, and GÃ¶delâ€™s incompleteness theorems.
- Axiomatic foundations: Zermeloâ€“Fraenkel set theory, and the development of mathematics therein, including ordinals, cardinals, transfinite recursion, the axiom of choice and its applications, and first independence results
- Model theory: structures and isomorphisms, elementary equivalence and embeddings, the LÃ¶wenheimâ€“Skolem theorems, categoricity, back-and-forth arguments, and applications/examples including non-standard analysis

## Textbooks

The course textbook is the following book: 

R. Cori, D. Lascar, 2001, _Mathematical Logic, A Course with Exercises, Part II: Recursion Theory, GÃ¶delâ€™s Theorems, Set Theory, Model Theory_, Oxford University Press.

I also highly recommend Jeremy Avigad's excellent book:

Avigad, Jeremy. 2022. _Mathematical Logic and Computation_. Cambridge University Press.

For Turing Machines we use 

Bridges, Douglas. 1994. _Computability: A Mathematical Sketchbook_. Springer.

### The Lean Diary

[https://github.com/sinhp/CompLean/](https://github.com/sinhp/CompLean/)

Lean is used as a digital diary for the first part of the course. The companion Lean code contains detailed definitions of the main concepts of the lectures, some basic examples and computations, and verified proofs of some of main theorems of computability and incompleteness.
