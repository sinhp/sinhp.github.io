The emphasis is on fundamental mathematical ideas (basic functional analysis, reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, concentration inequalities, uniform central limit theorems), basic statistical modeling techniques (e.g. linear regression, parametric and non-parametric methods), basic machine learning techniques for unsupervised (e.g. clustering, manifold learning), supervised (classification, regression), and semi-supervised learning, and corresponding computational aspects (linear algebra, basic linear and nonlinear optimization to attack the problems above). 


Applications will include statistical signal processing, imaging, inverse problems, graph processing, and problems at the intersection of statistics/machine learning and physical/dynamical systems (e.g. model reduction for stochastic dynamical systems).
