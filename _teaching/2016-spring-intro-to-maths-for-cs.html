       <ul> 
        <li> Coordinate geometry: Equations of lines and circles; gradients.
        </li>
        <li> Functions and their graphs: A very vivid way to describe functions and their properties. 
        </li>    
        <li> Functions at large x: This aspect of functions is interesting in its own right, but also important for analysing the efficiency of computer algorithms.
        </li> 
        <li> Differential calculus: Rules for finding gradients. This lies right at the heart of mathematical applications.
        </li> 
        <li> Differential calculus continued.
        </li> 
        <li> Polynomials: Manipulating them, and something about finding their roots.
        </li> 
        <li> Trigonometry: Calculating with angles.
        </li> 
        <li> Complex numbers: What happens if you invent an "imaginary" square root  of -1. The amazing idea that trigonometry is just imaginary exponentiation.
        </li>
        <li> Integration: Finding areas - or the opposite of differentiation.
        </li>
        <li> Simultaneous linear equations: Solving linear equations simultaneously.
        </li> 
       </ul>
